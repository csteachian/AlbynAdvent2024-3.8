      <h3>Why are elves such good motivational speakers?</h3>
      <p>
        <em>They have plenty of elf-confidence!</em>

      <h1>Mini story about Santa's Snowboarding Adventure!</h1>
      <p>
        One frosty December morning, Santa decided he needed a break. The North
        Pole was buzzing with elves, and the reindeer were busy training. So,
        Santa grabbed his snowboard and headed for the slopes. <br><br>Decked out in a
        red parka and goggles, he soared down the hill, laughing as he carved
        through the snow. It was all going well until Rudolph and the other
        reindeer showed up, cheering him on with jingling bells. Distracted,
        Santa hit a patch of ice and went flying into a snowdrift with a
        spectacular <em>poof!</em><br><br> Brushing off the snow, he grinned and shouted, “Almost
        as fun as a sleigh ride!” By the end of the day, Santa had mastered a
        360 spin—and maybe even a new way to deliver presents.
