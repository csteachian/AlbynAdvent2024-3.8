      What’s So Special About Santa’s Elves? 
    </h2> 
   <p align="center">
     The Christmas elves are so special because they do so much work for Santa! They make toys, craft decorations, do household tasks, look after the reindeer, and so much else.

The elves will fearlessly head into the cold night and do anything Santa asks for. They are brave, hard-working, and dedicated. Santa’s elves won’t stop until they have made the perfect Christmas!

      What Toys Do the Elves Make?
     </h3> 
     <p align="center">
      The elves are so good at crafting and toy making. They make wooden toys, plastic toys, board games, soft toys, and a range of other toys. Any toy you can think of, the elves can make. Every single toy that Santa delivers on Christmas eve is handmade by the elves. They are a very talented bunch!
