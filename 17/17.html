      <h1>Harbin's famous ice sculpture!</h1>
      <p>
        One of the most famous ice sculptures is the annual Harbin International
        Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival in China. Held in Harbin, this festival
        features massive, intricate sculptures carved from blocks of ice taken
        from the nearby Songhua River. These sculptures can reach up to 20 feet
        tall and are illuminated at night, creating a breathtaking, shimmering
        spectacle. The festival attracts artists from around the world, who use
        only ice and snow to create detailed replicas of castles, animals, and
        iconic landmarks, blending art with the natural beauty of winter. It has
        become a symbol of the creativity and craftsmanship involved in ice
        sculpting.
